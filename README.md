# DifHub Code Generation tools.
Set of tools for the integration with https://metucat.com (previously https://difhub.com). Contains API loader, codegen and IntelliJ Idea plugin. New features and instrumentation coming soon.

Projects:
1. openapi-load – API loader, connects to difhub.com, loads metadata of the selected system and converts it to the OpenAPI documents. 
2. codegen-cli – Codegen, takes OpenAPI specifications, settings, and generates project
3. intellij-idea – Plugin for the IntellijIdea to have UX.

## Installation and usage instructions

NOTE. Since project is in Preview, only usage in development mode available.

For new project:
1. Clone repository of the project
2. Run `./gradlew intellij-plugin:runIde`
